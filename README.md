# ü§ñ CI/CD and Automation Demo Repository

This repository serves as a practical demonstration and collection of scripts for common DevOps and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tasks, focusing primarily on automating Git operations and managing YAML configuration files within a Jenkins pipeline.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This project provides working examples for key automation tasks:

### Repository Cloning Automation: A Python script (clone_repo.py) for programmatically cloning Git repositories.

### YAML Configuration Management: A Python utility (update_yaml.py) for dynamically reading, modifying, and writing back YAML configuration files.

### Jenkins Pipeline Integration: A ready-to-use Jenkinsfile demonstrating how to integrate these scripts into a declarative CI/CD pipeline.

### DevOps Workflow Practice: Provides a testing ground for practicing common Git, Python scripting, and CI/CD concepts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the scripts or test the pipeline locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.x

The PyYAML library for configuration management.

Git installed on your system.

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/venkatesh-reddy-prog/demo.git

cd demo

### Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install pyyaml

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### 1. YAML Update Script (update_yaml.py)
This script demonstrates non-destructive updates to YAML files, which is useful for injecting version numbers or environment variables into configuration files during a deployment.

Example Execution:

Bash

python update_yaml.py <path/to/your/file.yaml> <key> <new_value>
(You may need to inspect the script for specific argument usage.)

### 2. Repository Cloning (clone_repo.py)
This script can be used to automate the process of fetching and updating external dependencies or configuration repositories within a build environment.

Example Execution:

Bash

python clone_repo.py <repo_url> <destination_folder>

### 3. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)
   
The Jenkinsfile provides a template for a declarative pipeline that typically performs the following stages:

Checkout: Fetches the source code.

Configuration Update: Runs update_yaml.py to prepare configuration files for the environment.

Dependency Checkout: Runs clone_repo.py to fetch necessary dependencies.

Build/Deploy: (Placeholder for application-specific build and deployment steps.)
